            Hello! My name is Jaclyn Alday. I am a newly certified full stack
            developer from Carolina Code School. I have a past as a vet tech, as
            well as an art degree. Animals and art have always been at the
            forefront of my life, and I look forward to utilizing my past
            experience in my new career. <br />
